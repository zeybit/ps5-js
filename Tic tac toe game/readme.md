This JavaScript code is a simple implementation of a tic-tac-toe game built using the p5.js library. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the winner being the first to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The code includes features like player input, score tracking, round management, and audio effects. Additionally, it randomly selects the starting player for each round to add variety to the gameplay.
